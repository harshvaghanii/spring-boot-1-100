## Folder Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- Each topic will have its own subdirectory under the main folder.
- Subdirectories will include example code, notes, and project files.  


## Tools and Technologies
Throughout this course, Iâ€™ll be using the following tools and technologies:
- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Maven/Gradle**
- **Postman** (for API testing)
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Apache Kafka**

## Goals
By the end of this course, I aim to:
- Build production-ready Spring Boot applications.
- Understand and implement microservices architecture.
- Deploy applications in Docker containers and orchestrate them using Kubernetes.
- Integrate messaging systems like Kafka.

Stay tuned for updates as I progress through the course! ðŸš€
